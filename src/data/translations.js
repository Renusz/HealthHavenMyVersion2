      faqSubtitle: 'If you are considering care in Mexico, you should have clear, honest answers.',

      faq1Q: 'What is MyHealth Haven™?',
      faq1A:
        'MyHealth Haven™ is an independent patient-advocacy and care-navigation company. We help U.S. patients access high-quality medical care in Mexico through carefully selected doctors, hospitals, and clinics—without advertising influence, or pay-to-play referrals.',
      faq2Q: 'Is MyHealth Haven™ a medical tourism or travel agency?',
      faq2A:
        'No. Unlike travel agencies or hospital marketing platforms, our primary focus is your care. We manage travel and logistics solely to support ensuring safe, well-coordinated medical outcomes.',
      faq3Q: 'How is MyHealth Haven™ different from other medical tourism companies?',
      faq3A:
        'Most medical tourism companies operate as marketplaces funded by clinic advertising or pay-to-play programs. MyHealth Haven™ does not accept advertising fees or engage in pay-to-play programs with providers. We are paid for guidance, coordination, and advocacy—so our incentives stay aligned with you, the patient.',
      faq4Q: 'How do you choose doctors, hospitals, and clinics?',
      faq4A:
        'We intentionally select a small, boutique network of providers based on: Facility competence, quality and outcomes history; Verified credentials and experience; Infection control and safety standards; Ongoing performance review. Providers are re-vetted regularly. Inclusion in our cadre is earned—not bought.',
      faq5Q: 'Are the medical standards comparable to the U.S.?',
      faq5A:
        'Yes. The doctors and facilities we work with always meet and in some cases exceed internationally recognized standards, many with U.S. or European training. Safety protocols, sterilization practices, and clinical governance are aligned with U.S. expectations.',
      faq6Q: 'Who helps me once I decide to move forward?',
      faq6A:
        'Every patient is paired with a dedicated Health Navigator™—a professional who serves as your single point of contact before, during, and after care. You are not passed between departments or call centers.',
      faq7Q: 'What does a Health Navigator™ do?',
      faq7A:
        'Your Health Navigator™ helps coordinate: Choices from vetted providers to select and scheduling; Clear, upfront pricing; 100% travel support; On-the-ground coordination; Medical record transfer; Post-procedure follow-up and continuity. Their role is to reduce uncertainty and ensure nothing falls through the cracks.',
      faq8Q: 'How does pricing work?',
      faq8A:
        'You receive a clear all-inclusive quote before your care journey begins. There are no surprise add-on fees, no last-minute changes, and no hidden incentives influencing recommendations.',
      faq9Q: 'What happens after my procedure?',
      faq9A:
        'Continuity of care matters. We coordinate required in-country follow-ups and help ensure relevant records are available for your U.S. providers when you return home. Care does not end when you leave the facility.',
      faq10Q: 'Is this for emergency care?',
      faq10A:
        'No. MyHealth Haven™ supports planned, elective, diagnostic, and preventative care. We do not coordinate emergency or urgent-care services.',
      faq11Q: 'Do you help with travel and lodging?',
      faq11A:
        'We support travel and lodging related to your medical travel 100%. We are not however a travel agency. Our focus remains medical safety, timing, and continuity—not selling trips or packages.',
      faq12Q: 'Are the patient testimonials real?',
      faq12A:
        'Yes. Testimonials reflect real patient experiences. Language may be lightly edited for clarity or privacy, but stories are authentic and verifiable internally.',
      faq13Q: 'Does MyHealth Haven™ accept insurance, Medicare, or Medicaid?',
      faq13A:
        'No. MyHealth Haven™ operates as a cash-pay model and does not bill private insurance, Medicare, or Medicaid. This approach allows us to focus on high-quality care without the administrative complexity, delays, and coverage limitations often associated with insurance-based systems. Many patients find that even without using insurance, the total cost of care is lower than U.S. out-of-pocket expenses after deductibles, copays, and uncovered services. Our priority is transparent pricing, timely access to care, and clinical standards aligned with U.S. expectations—without insurance-driven constraints.',

          content: `
Medical travel sometimes called medical tourism can sound unfamiliar, even intimidating, until you slow down and ask the right question. Not “Is it cheaper?” or “Is it safe?” but something more personal:
Does this model of care actually fit me, my health needs, and how I make decisions?
For many people, medical travel isn’t about bargain-hunting or cutting corners. It’s about reclaiming control over timelines, clarity, cost, and the experience of care itself. For others, it’s simply not the right choice. And that’s okay.
This guide is designed to help you decide calmly, honestly, and without pressure.

WHY PEOPLE CONSIDER MEDICAL TRAVEL
Most patients who explore medical travel don’t start with a desire to leave the U.S. healthcare system. They start with friction.
Long wait times for consultations or procedures
Confusing or opaque pricing even with insurance
Fragmented care across multiple providers
Limited time with physicians
Feeling rushed, processed, or unheard
Medical travel becomes attractive when patients realize there are healthcare models built differently models that prioritize time, transparency, and coordination rather than volume.

WHAT MEDICAL TRAVEL ACTUALLY LOOKS LIKE (WHEN DONE WELL)
High-quality medical travel is not improvised care. At its best, it includes:
Care-first planning
Pre-reviewed providers
Clear, all-inclusive pricing
Virtual consultations before travel
Dedicated care coordination

MEDICAL TRAVEL MAY BE RIGHT FOR YOU IF:
You value clarity over complexity
You’re comfortable planning ahead
You want more time with your care team
You’re open, but not reckless
You’re planning non-emergency care

WHEN MEDICAL TRAVEL MAY NOT BE THE RIGHT FIT
Emergency or unstable care needs
Discomfort with travel
Preference for traditional insurance-only pathways

THE ROLE OF GUIDANCE
Successful medical travel includes personal care navigation, coordination, and follow-up support.

A FINAL THOUGHT
Medical travel isn’t about replacing your local healthcare system. It’s about expanding your options.

      faq1A:
        'MyHealth Haven™ es una empresa independiente de defensa del paciente y navegación de atención. Ayudamos a los pacientes de EE.UU. a acceder a atención médica de alta calidad en México a través de médicos, hospitales y clínicas cuidadosamente seleccionados, sin influencia publicitaria ni referencias de pago por juego.',
      faq2Q: '¿Es MyHealth Haven™ una agencia de turismo médico o de viajes?',
      faq2A:
        'No. A diferencia de las agencias de viajes o las plataformas de marketing hospitalario, nuestro enfoque principal es su atención. Gestionamos los viajes y la logística únicamente para apoyar y asegurar resultados médicos seguros y bien coordinados.',
      faq3Q: '¿En qué se diferencia MyHealth Haven™ de otras empresas de turismo médico?',
      faq3A:
        'La mayoría de las empresas de turismo médico operan como mercados financiados por publicidad clínica o programas de pago por juego. MyHealth Haven™ no acepta tarifas publicitarias ni participa en programas de pago por juego con proveedores. Se nos paga por orientación, coordinación y defensa, por lo que nuestros incentivos se mantienen alineados con usted, el paciente.',
      faq4Q: '¿Cómo eligen a los médicos, hospitales y clínicas?',
      faq4A:
        'Seleccionamos intencionalmente una red pequeña y boutique de proveedores basada en: Competencia de las instalaciones, historia de calidad y resultados; Credenciales y experiencia verificadas; Estándares de control de infecciones y seguridad; Revisión continua del desempeño. Los proveedores son re-verificados regularmente. La inclusión en nuestro grupo se gana, no se compra.',
      faq5Q: '¿Son los estándares médicos comparables a los de EE.UU.?',
      faq5A:
        'Sí. Los médicos e instalaciones con los que trabajamos siempre cumplen y, en algunos casos, superan los estándares reconocidos internacionalmente, muchos con formación en EE.UU. o Europa. Los protocolos de seguridad, las prácticas de esterilización y la gobernanza clínica están alineados con las expectativas de EE.UU.',
      faq6Q: '¿Quién me ayuda una vez que decido seguir adelante?',
      faq6A:
        'Cada paciente es emparejado con un Navegador de Salud™ dedicado, un profesional que sirve como su único punto de contacto antes, durante y después de la atención. No se le pasa entre departamentos o centros de llamadas.',
      faq7Q: '¿Qué hace un Navegador de Salud™?',
      faq7A:
        'Su Navegador de Salud™ ayuda a coordinar: Opciones de proveedores verificados para seleccionar y programar; Precios claros y por adelantado; 100% de apoyo en viajes; Coordinación en el terreno; Transferencia de registros médicos; Seguimiento post-procedimiento y continuidad. Su papel es reducir la incertidumbre y asegurar que nada se pase por alto.',
      faq8Q: '¿Cómo funciona el precio?',
      faq8A:
        'Usted recibe una cotización clara y todo incluido antes de que comience su viaje de atención. No hay tarifas adicionales sorpresa, cambios de último minuto ni incentivos ocultos que influyan en las recomendaciones.',
      faq9Q: '¿Qué sucede después de mi procedimiento?',
      faq9A:
        'La continuidad de la atención importa. Coordinamos los seguimientos requeridos en el país y ayudamos a asegurar que los registros relevantes estén disponibles para sus proveedores en EE.UU. cuando regrese a casa. La atención no termina cuando sale de la instalación.',
      faq10Q: '¿Es esto para atención de emergencia?',
      faq10A:
        'No. MyHealth Haven™ apoya la atención planificada, electiva, diagnóstica y preventiva. No coordinamos servicios de emergencia o atención urgente.',
      faq11Q: '¿Ayudan con el viaje y el alojamiento?',
      faq11A:
        'Apoyamos el viaje y el alojamiento relacionados con su viaje médico al 100%. Sin embargo, no somos una agencia de viajes. Nuestro enfoque sigue siendo la seguridad médica, el tiempo y la continuidad, no vender viajes o paquetes.',
      faq12Q: '¿Son reales los testimonios de los pacientes?',
      faq12A:
        'Sí. Los testimonios reflejan experiencias reales de pacientes. El lenguaje puede ser ligeramente editado por claridad o privacidad, pero las historias son auténticas y verificables internamente.',
      faq13Q: '¿MyHealth Haven™ acepta seguros, Medicare o Medicaid?',
      faq13A:
        'No. MyHealth Haven™ opera bajo un modelo de pago en efectivo y no factura a seguros privados, Medicare o Medicaid. Este enfoque nos permite centrarnos en la atención de alta calidad sin la complejidad administrativa, los retrasos y las limitaciones de cobertura a menudo asociadas con los sistemas basados en seguros. Muchos pacientes encuentran que incluso sin usar seguro, el costo total de la atención es menor que los gastos de bolsillo en EE.UU. después de deducibles, copagos y servicios no cubiertos. Nuestra prioridad es precios transparentes, acceso oportuno a la atención y estándares clínicos alineados con las expectativas de EE.UU., sin restricciones impulsadas por seguros.',

El turismo médico a veces llamado viaje médico puede sonar desconocido, incluso intimidante, hasta que reduce la velocidad y hace la pregunta correcta. No "¿Es más barato?" o "¿Es seguro?", sino algo más personal:
¿Este modelo de atención realmente se adapta a mí, a mis necesidades de salud y a cómo tomo decisiones?
Para muchas personas, el turismo médico no se trata de buscar gangas o tomar atajos. Se trata de reclamar el control sobre los plazos, la claridad, el costo y la experiencia de la atención en sí. Para otros, simplemente no es la elección correcta. Y eso está bien.
Esta guía está diseñada para ayudarlo a decidir con calma, honestidad y sin presión.

POR QUÉ LA GENTE CONSIDERA EL TURISMO MÉDICO
La mayoría de los pacientes que exploran el turismo médico no comienzan con el deseo de abandonar el sistema de salud de EE.UU. Comienzan con fricción.
Largos tiempos de espera para consultas o procedimientos
Precios confusos u opacos incluso con seguro
Atención fragmentada entre múltiples proveedores
Tiempo limitado con los médicos
Sentirse apresurado, procesado o no escuchado
El turismo médico se vuelve atractivo cuando los pacientes se dan cuenta de que hay modelos de atención médica construidos de manera diferente, modelos que priorizan el tiempo, la transparencia y la coordinación en lugar del volumen.

CÓMO SE VE REALMENTE EL TURISMO MÉDICO (CUANDO SE HACE BIEN)
El turismo médico de alta calidad no es atención improvisada. En su mejor momento, incluye:
Planificación centrada en la atención
Proveedores revisados previamente
Precios claros y todo incluido
Consultas virtuales antes de viajar
Coordinación de atención dedicada

EL TURISMO MÉDICO PUEDE SER ADECUADO PARA USTED SI:
Valora la claridad sobre la complejidad
Se siente cómodo planificando con anticipación
Desea más tiempo con su equipo de atención
Es abierto, pero no imprudente
Está planeando atención no urgente

CUANDO EL TURISMO MÉDICO PUEDE NO SER LA OPCIÓN CORRECTA
Necesidades de atención de emergencia o inestables
Incomodidad con los viajes
Preferencia por las vías tradicionales de solo seguro

EL PAPEL DE LA ORIENTACIÓN
El turismo médico exitoso incluye navegación de atención personal, coordinación y apoyo de seguimiento.

UN PENSAMIENTO FINAL
El turismo médico no se trata de reemplazar su sistema de salud local. Se trata de expandir sus opciones.

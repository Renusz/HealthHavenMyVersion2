        "If you are considering care in Mexico, you should have clear, honest answers.",

      faq1Q: "What is MyHealth Haven™?",
      faq1A:
        "MyHealth Haven™ is an independent patient-advocacy and care-navigation company. We help U.S. patients access high-quality medical care in Mexico through carefully selected doctors, hospitals, and clinics—without advertising influence, or pay-to-play referrals.",
      faq2Q: "Is MyHealth Haven™ a medical tourism or travel agency?",
      faq2A:
        "No. Unlike travel agencies or hospital marketing platforms, our primary focus is your care. We manage travel and logistics solely to support ensuring safe, well-coordinated medical outcomes.",
      faq3Q:
        "How is MyHealth Haven™ different from other medical tourism companies?",
      faq3A:
        "Most medical tourism companies operate as marketplaces funded by clinic advertising or pay-to-play programs. MyHealth Haven™ does not accept advertising fees or engage in pay-to-play programs with providers. We are paid for guidance, coordination, and advocacy—so our incentives stay aligned with you, the patient.",
      faq4Q: "How do you choose doctors, hospitals, and clinics?",
      faq4A:
        "We intentionally select a small, boutique network of providers based on: Facility competence, quality and outcomes history; Verified credentials and experience; Infection control and safety standards; Ongoing performance review. Providers are re-vetted regularly. Inclusion in our cadre is earned—not bought.",
      faq5Q: "Are the medical standards comparable to the U.S.?",
      faq5A:
        "Yes. The doctors and facilities we work with always meet and in some cases exceed internationally recognized standards, many with U.S. or European training. Safety protocols, sterilization practices, and clinical governance are aligned with U.S. expectations.",
      faq6Q: "Who helps me once I decide to move forward?",
      faq6A:
        "Every patient is paired with a dedicated Health Navigator™—a professional who serves as your single point of contact before, during, and after care. You are not passed between departments or call centers.",
      faq7Q: "What does a Health Navigator™ do?",
      faq7A:
        "Your Health Navigator™ helps coordinate: Choices from vetted providers to select and scheduling; Clear, upfront pricing; 100% travel support; On-the-ground coordination; Medical record transfer; Post-procedure follow-up and continuity. Their role is to reduce uncertainty and ensure nothing falls through the cracks.",
      faq8Q: "How does pricing work?",
      faq8A:
        "You receive a clear all-inclusive quote before your care journey begins. There are no surprise add-on fees, no last-minute changes, and no hidden incentives influencing recommendations.",
      faq9Q: "What happens after my procedure?",
      faq9A:
        "Continuity of care matters. We coordinate required in-country follow-ups and help ensure relevant records are available for your U.S. providers when you return home. Care does not end when you leave the facility.",
      faq10Q: "Is this for emergency care?",
      faq10A:
        "No. MyHealth Haven™ supports planned, elective, diagnostic, and preventative care. We do not coordinate emergency or urgent-care services.",
      faq11Q: "Do you help with travel and lodging?",
      faq11A:
        "We support travel and lodging related to your medical travel 100%. We are not however a travel agency. Our focus remains medical safety, timing, and continuity—not selling trips or packages.",
      faq12Q: "Are the patient testimonials real?",
      faq12A:
        "Yes. Testimonials reflect real patient experiences. Language may be lightly edited for clarity or privacy, but stories are authentic and verifiable internally.",
      faq13Q: "Does MyHealth Haven™ accept insurance, Medicare, or Medicaid?",
      faq13A:
        "No. MyHealth Haven™ operates as a cash-pay model and does not bill private insurance, Medicare, or Medicaid. This approach allows us to focus on high-quality care without the administrative complexity, delays, and coverage limitations often associated with insurance-based systems. Many patients find that even without using insurance, the total cost of care is lower than U.S. out-of-pocket expenses after deductibles, copays, and uncovered services. Our priority is transparent pricing, timely access to care, and clinical standards aligned with U.S. expectations—without insurance-driven constraints.",
